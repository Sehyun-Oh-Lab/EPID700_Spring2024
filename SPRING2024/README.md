# <p align="center">EPID 700, Spring 2024</p>

Welcome to the course page for the City University of New York, SPH: Population Health Informatics Project, Spring 2024. You may find the course syllabus [here](https://github.com/evoheal/EPID-700/blob/main/SPRING2024/EPID%20700%20Syllabus%20Spring%202024.pdf); however, the course structure is flexible and may be adjusted over the semester to best support student needs. Please refer to this page to remain updated.

## Instructors
Nash Rochman<br/>
Epidemiology and Biostatistics<br/>

Sehyun Oh<br/>

## Course Objectives

This course is designed to support each student in the pursuit of original public health research, culminating in a citable work made available as a preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) if submission for peer review is planned or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) otherwise.<br/>
Milestones **due by**:

* 30 min. 1-1 introductory meeting with Nash or Sehyun **2/2**
* 5 min. class presentations **2/9**
* Finalized research objectives **2/26**
* Outline for introduction and methods live on course page **3/4**
* Mock grant review **3/11**
* Course symposium, 20 min. presentations **4/1**
* Outline for final citable work live on course page **4/12**
* Mock publication review **4/19**
* Final draft of citable work live on course page **5/10**
* Submission of citable work to indexed repository **5/22**

This timeline is recommended to ensure that submission to an indexed repository is completed by **May 22, 2024**. Extensions, for any milestone and not limited to final submission, will only be granted after the course instructor has received email confirmation that the faculty advisor for the student requesting the extension has been made aware of the request without objection.

## Current Objective
At the time of writing, **Febuary 5, 2024**, the current objective is:
* 5 min. class presentations is due **11:59PM EST Friday, 2/9**, email comments are due **11:59PM EST Wednesday, 2/14**

Students unable to join this group session must record their presentations and share with the class over email. Recorded presentations are due at the start of the group session.<br/>

These brief presentations are designed to introduce each research project to the class to motivate feedback which will help to shape the goals for the remainder of the semester. There are no formatting requirements, but the following structure is likely to be successful:

* (Title Slide)
* Project Motivation: What problem do you intend to solve?
* Current State of the Field: What do people currently do to address these challenges? Why are these approaches insufficient?
* Long Term Vision: What is your vision for how this problem will be completely solved (perhaps far into the future as a result of great effort exerted by many people)?
* Immediate Impact: How does your capstone project make progress towards your long term vision?
* Data: How will you get the data that supports this project?
* Known Methods: What techinques, with which you are already familiar, will you use to achieve your immediate impact?
* Unknown Methods: What techniques do you need to learn?

7 slides in 5 minutes. This dense format requires clear, concise presentation which should be practiced several times before sharing with the class. Writing a script is recommended. Fundamentally, the goal is to engage your classmates so they understand and are excited by your work, and are in a strong position to make constructive comments.<br/>

After all presentations have been shared, an email thread for each project will be started. Every student must reply to every thread. These emails must be written according to the following format, with one paragraph for each point:

* What did you understand to be the immediate impact of the project?
* Describe one way in which you are confident the project will be successful.
* Describe one way in which you are concerned the project will be unsuccessful.
* What was your favorite aspect of the presentation design (in contrast to the science)?
* What was your least favorite aspect of the presentation design?
* Make one "out of the box" suggestion for the project.


## Next Objective
At the time of writing, **Febuary 5, 2024**, the next objective is:
* Finalized research objectives **2/26**

Your statement of research objectives will serve as a rough outline of the mock grant proposal to be completed in the next milestone. You must have at least 3 independent sets of objectives grouped into aims, each of which could be completed even if all others are unsuccessful. Your objectives must be within the scope of this course. Submission of the next milestone will not be accepted until I am confident the proposed project will be successful.</br>

Each objective must be assessed in three ways.</br>

1) The outcome is (0) certain or (1) uncertain. For example, formulating survey questions has a certain outcome - you end up with a list of survey questions. Identifying that group X responded differently from group Y to a set of survey questions has an uncertain outcome - you may end up supporting the null hypothesis.
2) I can complete this objective if I<br/>
   a) use only publicly available data which may immediately be accessed in a convenient format<br/>
   b) use publicly available data which I need to organize myself<br/>
   c) collect new data (through a survey, experiment, simulation, etc.)<br/>
4) I can complete this objective using techniques I<br/>
   A) have already mastered<br/>
   B) will learn from an available step-by-step reference guide<br/>
   C) will understand after completing a specified intensive learning plan (e.g. online course).<br/>

There is no required number of objectives in each category. This assessment primarily seves to ensure that you and I have a mutual understanding about what aspects of the proposed work require the greatest time investment. Any objective labelled b/B or c/C must be accompanied by the relevant supporting information. Your statement of research objectives should follow the below format:</br>

**Title**</br>

Introductory paragraph.</br>

Aim 1: Title of Aim 1

* *Objective 1[objective assessment e.g. 1bA]* Statement of objective including relevant [references](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
* ...

Aim 2: Title of Aim 2

* ...

You will make your reserach objectives live on the course page which will require you to create a github account and send me your username so that I can invite you to edit.






## Frequently Asked Questions
* Will our project be related to our fieldwork or is it up to us what topic we pick?

This course is structured to be a continuation of your fieldwork; however, any topic which may be developed into a citable reference by the end of the semester will be supported.

* Regarding 5 min. presentations: are we expected to answer all questions for each presentation per student and will our responses be written on the discussion board or another format?

As stated above, "After all presentations have been shared, an email thread for each project will be started. Every student must reply to every thread."
