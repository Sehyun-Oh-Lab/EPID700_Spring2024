# <p align="center">EPID 700, Fall 2023</p>

Welcome to the course page for the City University of New York, SPH: Population Health Informatics Project, Fall 2023. You may find the course syllabus [here](https://github.com/evoheal/EPID-700-Fall-2023/blob/main/EPID%20700%20Syllabus%20Fall%202023.pdf); however, the course structure is flexible and will be adjusted over the semester to best support student needs. Please refer to this page to remain updated.

## Instructor
Nash Rochman<br/>
Epidemiology and Biostatistics<br/>
CUNY, SPH

## Course Objectives

This course is designed to support each student in the pursuit of original public health research, culminating in a citable work made available as a preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) if submission for peer review is planned or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) otherwise.<br/>
Milestones **due by**:

* 30 min. 1-1 introductory meeting with Nash **9/4**
* 5 min. class presentations **9/8**
* Finalized research objectives **9/13**
* Outline for introduction and methods live on course page **9/18**
* Mock grant review **10/6**
* Course symposium, 15 min. presentations **11/3**
* Outline for final citable work live on course page **11/24**
* Mock publication review **12/1**
* Final draft of citable work live on course page **12/8**
* Submission of citable work to indexed repository **12/15**

This timeline is recommended to ensure that submission to an indexed repository is completed by **December 15, 2023**. Extensions, for any milestone and not limited to final submission, will only be granted after the course instructor has received email confirmation that the faculty advisor for the student requesting the extension has been made aware of the request without objection.

## Current Objective
At the time of writing, **August 30, 2023**, the current objective is:
* 5 min. class presentations **7-9PM EST Wednesday, 9/6**, email comments are due **9AM EST Friday, 9/8**

Students unable to join this group session must record their presentations and share with the class over email. Recorded presentations are due at the start of the group session.<br/>

These brief presentations are designed to introduce each research project to the class to motivate feedback which will help to shape the goals for the remainder of the semester. There are no formatting requirements, but the following structure is likely to be successful:

* (Title Slide)
* Project Motivation: What problem do you intend to solve?
* Current State of the Field: What do people currently do to address these challenges? Why are these approaches insufficient?
* Long Term Vision: What is your vision for how this problem will be completely solved (perhaps far into the future as a result of great effort exerted by many people)?
* Immediate Impact: How does your capstone project make progress towards your long term vision?
* Data: How will you get the data that supports this project?
* Known Methods: What techinques, with which you are already familiar, will you use to achieve your immediate impact?
* Unknown Methods: What techniques do you need to learn?

7 slides in 5 minutes. This dense format requires clear, concise presentation which should be practiced several times before sharing with the class. Writing a script is recommended. Fundamentally, the goal is to engage your classmates so they understand and are excited by your work, and are in a strong position to make constructive comments.<br/>

After all presentations have been shared, an email thread for each project will be started. Every student must reply to every thread. These emails must be written according to the following format, with one paragraph for each point:

* What did you understand to be the immediate impact of the project?
* Describe one way in which you are confident the project will be successful.
* Describe one way in which you are concerned the project will be unsuccessful.
* What was your favorite aspect of the presentation design (in contrast to the science)?
* What was your least favorite aspect of the presentation design?
* Make one "out of the box" suggestion for the project.


## Next Objective
At the time of writing, **August 30, 2023**, the next objective is:
* Finalized research objectives **9/13**

Detailed requirements for this objective will be posted in the next several days.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* Will our project be related to our fieldwork or is it up to us what topic we pick?

This course is structured to be a continuation of your fieldwork; however, any topic which may be developed into a citable reference by the end of the semester will be supported.

* Regarding 5 min. presentations: are we expected to answer all questions for each presentation per student and will our responses be written on the discussion board or another format?

As stated above, "After all presentations have been shared, an email thread for each project will be started. Every student must reply to every thread."
