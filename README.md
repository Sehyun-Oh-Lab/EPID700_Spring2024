## Course Objectives

This course is designed to support each student in the pursuit of original public health research, culminating in a citable work made available as a preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) if submission for peer review is planned or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) otherwise.<br/>
Milestones **due by**:

* 30 min. 1-1 introductory meeting with Nash **9/4**
* 5 min. class presentations **9/8**
* Finalized research objectives **9/15**
* Outline for introduction and methods live on course page **9/22**
* Mock grant review **10/6**
* Course symposium, 15 min. presentations **11/3**
* Outline for final citable work live on course page **11/24**
* Mock publication review **12/1**
* Final draft of citable work live on course page **12/8**
* Submission of citable work to indexed repository **12/15**

This timeline is recommended to ensure that submission to an indexed repository is completed by **December 15, 2023**. Extensions, for any milestone and not limited to final submission, will only be granted after the course instructor has received email confirmation that the faculty advisor for the student requesting the extension has been made aware of the request without objection.

## Current Objective
At the time of writing, **September 18, 2023**, the current objective is:
* Outline for introduction and methods live on course page **9/22**

Now the goals for each project have been identified. The goals have been succinctly motiviated (why is this work important?) and practically supported (how will this get done in the next three months?). The next step is to formalize these goals in a longer, more detailed project outline which will be shared with a peer reviewer from the class in the next milestone. This peer reviewer will score the outline as if it had been submitted to a grant review committee, primarily evaluating how well the proposal addresses *impact, novelty, and practicality*. The idea presented and the author's preparedness will be scored separately. Note that these peer review scores will not impact the course grade.<br/>

The project outline will have three sections, *Introduction* and *Methods* as well as an *Abstract*. The abstract will be a refined version of the introductory paragraph from the previous milestone. It must be between 200-300 words and will not contain references. The abstract should be written in a style consistent with a peer reviewed publication. The introduction and methods sections should NOT be written in formal style as these sections will be reshaped from now until the course symposium.<br/>

Instead, the material in these sections should be presented as bullet points. References must be provided for these sections. Only "essential" references are required at this stage. For example, here it is appropriate to write "COVID-19 will remain a significant public health concern for several years". In the final milestone this statement should be justified with a reference including economic or epidemiological forecasts. There is no required number of bullet points or references; however, **20-50 points** and **10-20 references** is appropriate for most topics. Each reference should be included as a hyperlink with the text displayed corresponding to the title of the cited article<br/>

Additionally, it is important to include information about your prior experience as an author within this outline if that prior experience is essential for the successful completion of the proposal.<br/>

Points must be specific. Here are examples of different varieties of appropriate points:
(Introduction)
* Transmissible cancers are widespread in diverse species and understudied
* Bivalves are strongly affected [Widespread transmission of independent cancer lineages within multiple bivalve species](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18599)

<br/>

* Heart disease remains a major cause of mortality in the US
* Cardiovascular exercise decreases risk but there is a need for improved dosing guidelines [Optimal Dose of Running for Longevity: Is More Better or Worse?](https://www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacc.2014.11.022)

<br/>

* Climate instability is of rapidly growing global concern
* Using publicly available satellite data [An overview of MODIS Land data processing and product status](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425702000846) I will report how yearly temperature fluctuations in New York State have varied from 2010 to the present

(Methods)
* I will begin by building an updated species tree for moluscs

<br/>

* Using previously published running biomechanics data [A public dataset of running biomechanics and the effects of running speed on lower extremity kinematics and kinetics](https://peerj.com/articles/3298/) I will compute the relative risk for injury during a 5k and a marthon between adults aged 18-65 and >65

<br/>

* I will compute the average temperature at each grid location over a sliding window of 1 year and measure the daily deviation from that temperature over time.

Here are examples of inappropriate points:<br/>
(too vague)
* I will assess the needs of local residents
* I will analyze this data set [A public dataset of running biomechanics and the effects of running speed on lower extremity kinematics and kinetics](https://peerj.com/articles/3298/)
* Stakeholders will inform the construction of my survey

(citation needed - if true)
* The world record marathon time is within 5 minutes of the established theoretical limit
* Daily fast food sales records within NYC from 2015 to the present are publicly available
* The majority of gas stoves in the US generate CO levels which exceed federal guidelines

On formatting:<br/>
To prevent accidents associated with editing a different student's project, instead of directly editing the course page, you will work within your own GitHub repository. If you are new to GitHub, you may follow this step-by-step [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to create your first repository. For this milestone, you may only need to generate a single file, the "README.md" file which should automatically be initialized when you create your repository.<br/>

You may consider using this [template](https://github.com/evoheal/EPID-700-Fall-2023/blob/main/Introduction_and_methods_template.md) which only uses three basic formatting functions:
1) creating a heading, "##"
2) line breaks, "\<br/>"
3) hyperlinks, "\[display text](web address)"

Other more flexible options are [possible](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) if desired. For this and most future milestones, I will upload the final result to the course page for you (in the folders linked at the top of this document which are currently empty).

## Next Objective
At the time of writing, **September 18, 2023**, the next objective is:
* Mock grant review **10/6**

In this objective, you will review a classmate's introduction and methods outline and make an assessment primarily considering three things:
1) Is this proposal *novel*? In other words, how different is this study from previously published work? Not all important science is novel. For example, replicating or failing to replicate a shocking result is critical to assessing validity.
2) Is this proposal *practical*? Can this reasonably completed by the author within 3 months? This will depend on the author's prior preparation. If the author states they have extensive prior programming experience, building a searchable database and hosting it on the web may be easily achieved. If the author has never coded before, this is entirely impractical.
3) Lastly, is this proposal *impactful*? In your assessment of impact, it is essential for you to consider each proposal in the context of this course for which everyone has very limited time. A project which is quite narrow in scope but which completely addresses an interesting question, generating data or consensus through review of published material that future investigators may reasonably be expected to use, is the kind of impact we are hoping to achieve. We want to avoid projects which are very ambitious and very broad which, at the end of 3 months of work, do not result in any complete, unambiguous results even if the original problem statement is more appealing.

The peer assessment will follow the format below. Up to **5 points** are assigned each statement according to how much the reviewer **disagrees** with the statement - lower scores are better.<br/>

**NOVELTY**
* There is not much literature on this topic.
* The methods applied are new to this area.
* This study is likely to motivate further research

**PRACTICALITY**
* I could follow the methods well enough to conduct this study myself with enough time.
* The author has carefully considered how much time each step will take.
* I agree with the assessment that this proposal can be completed in 3 months.
* The author has demonstrated that they have the prior experience required to successfully conduct this work.

**IMPACT**
* The results of this study will be of interest to a broad audience.
* This study addresses an established public health need.
* The results of this study are likely to be utilized in future research.

Peer reviewers must provide at least **3 sentences** of justification for each score. The grade associated with this assignment is for the contribution as a reviewer. The peer review score you receive for your own proposal does not affect your grade.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* Will our project be related to our fieldwork or is it up to us what topic we pick?

This course is structured to be a continuation of your fieldwork; however, any topic which may be developed into a citable reference by the end of the semester will be supported.

* Regarding 5 min. presentations: are we expected to answer all questions for each presentation per student and will our responses be written on the discussion board or another format?

As stated above, "After all presentations have been shared, an email thread for each project will be started. Every student must reply to every thread."
