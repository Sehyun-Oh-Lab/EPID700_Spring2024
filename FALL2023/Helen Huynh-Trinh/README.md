## Abstract
The US state and local public health workforce (PHW) lost approximately 40,000 jobs between 2009 and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an uptick in PHW growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, but it is unclear if this growth can or will be sustained. The de Beaumont Foundation (2021) estimated that approximately  80,000 (LHDs = 54,000 and state health agency central offices = 26,000) full-time equivalent (FTE) public health workers are needed to meet the demands for providing minimum public health services and staffing for local health departments. Therefore, training programs aimed at addressing the demand for public health (PH) jobs will be needed. To accurately determine which PH occupations should be targeted, an enumeration of the current public health workforce is required. There have been various PHW enumerations in the past but the outcomes remain insufficient due to gaps in public health workforce data. There is a lack of Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes for PH workers defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which are used for workforce enumerations. There are various public health occupations without SOC codes that cannot be linked to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes which would allow tracking PH occupations across various industries. ​To address the gap in the enumeration of the public health workforce, linking public health occupations by SOC codes and NAICS industry codes in a central database is essential. To address the decrease in the PHW and creating targeted PH training programs to meet the future demands, conducting a spatial analysis based on the ASPPH data of the enrollments and graduation rates of public health students by degree type nationally and by state will offer insight trends in PH education pre and post COVID-19.  enrollments and graduation rates of public health students by degree type nationally and by state will offer insight trends in PH education pre and post COVID-19. <br/>

* Between 2017 and 2021, 46% of U.S. public health workers from state and local public health agencies left their jobs.

* During the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 100,000 registered nurses were estimated to have left the PHW. [Examining the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Burnout and Stress Among U.S. Nurses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10074070/)
  
* After the 2008 recession, the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) estimated that local health departments (LHD) lost 20% (37,000 jobs) of their workforce between 2008 and 2019, just before the pandemic.

* The de Beaumont Foundation (2021) estimated that approximately  80,000 (LHDs = approx. 54,000 and state health agency central offices = 26,000) full-time equivalent (FTE) public health workers are needed to meet the demands for providing minimum public health services and staffing for local health departments.

* Therefore, training programs aimed at addressing the demand for public health jobs will be needed. To accurately determine which public health occupations should be targeted, an enumeration of the current public health workforce is required.

* An enumeration will assess the size and composition of the national workforce to measure if the public health workforce is large and trained to deliver essential public health services to the US population.

* Gebbie and colleagues (2009) emphasized that a major challenge in enumerating the PHW is due to how broad and fragmented the Public Health (PH) industry. 
[Public Health Workforce Enumeration](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2008.137539/)

* Beck and colleagues attempted to enumerate the PHW again in 2014 but also found the data to be lacking despite using a total of six various data sources. [Enumeration of the Governmental Public Health Workforce, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944190/)

* Unlike with other occupations, there is a lack of Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes for PH workers defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which are used for workforce enumerations. [The Public Health Workforce Taxonomy: Revisions and Recommendations for Implementation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5932291/)

* There are various public health occupations without SOC codes that cannot be linked to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes which would allow tracking PH occupations across various industries (e.g., Educational, Health Care, Manufacturing). ​

* To address the gap in the enumeration of the public health workforce, linking public health occupations by SOC codes and NAICS industry codes are required. ​

* I will identify similarities in public health related occupations via a qualitative analysis of public records to create a condensed public health occupational titles for analysis. [Enumeration of the Public Health Workforce in New York State: Workforce Changes in the Wake of COVID-19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9602598/)

* For the qualitative analysis of the PHW, I will create a database with the SOC and NAICS public health codes that will be used to conduct a longitudinal data analysis to illustrate the various types of public health workers (i.e., epidemiologists, nurses, community health workers, occupational safety occupations) that are employed across various industries nationally and by state.​ [Labour market competition for public health graduates in the United States: A comparison of workforce taxonomies with job postings before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hpm.3128)

## Methods
### SOC/NAICS Combined Database + Pivot Tables
* I will begin by building an Excel database that combines the public health occupational titles from Local Health Departments with Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.

* The datasets for the SOC are publicly available for free download. The data sets that will be used for this research will be from 2015 - 2022. [Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/)

* The CUNY Pandemic Response Institute (PRI) workforce enumeration team has linked various occupational titles listings from LHD to direct title matches to  SOC Titles, SOC Definitions, and SOC Codes. 

* The datasets for the NAICS are publicly available for free download. The NAICS codes are updated every five years so the datasets that will be used for this research are the 2017 and 2022 datasets. [North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)](https://www.census.gov/naics/?58967?yearbck=2022)

* Using the LHD and SOC title matched data provided by the PRI team, I downloaded the NAICS datasets from 2015-2022 to match the SOC titles and SOC Codes to the NAICS industries to create the combined SOC and NAICS database via Microsoft Excel. 

* I will create a pivot table from the SOC and NAICS database for the PHW Employment by sector (2-digit) nationally.

* I will create a pivot table from the SOC and NAICS database from the Database for Employment for each state.

### Spatial Analysis
* I will obtain and organize the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH) graduation datasets for the years 2022, 2021, 2020, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 by accredited schools/programs by discipline and summarize the data by state (if possible, differentiate by modality). [Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH)](https://aspph.org/membership/data/)

* The ASPPH datasets are  available online but require a membership to access and download the data. The dataset will be obtained from the CUNY Pandemic Response Institute team. [Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH)](https://aspph.org/membership/data/)

* After organizing the ASPHH, I will conduct the Global Moran-I spatial autocorrelation analysis (mapping) based on the ASPPH data on the spatial analysis software, GeoDa which is a free and open source software tool. [GeoDa on Github](http://geodacenter.github.io) 

* After conducting the Global Moran-I spatial autocorrelation analysis, I will report the spatial characteristics of public health trained professionals before and after the COVID-19 pandemic on a national level.
